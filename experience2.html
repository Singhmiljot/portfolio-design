1. CSS file has been restored to original state
2. Next step is to restore the HTML file
3. Need to remove any added interactive elements and mode toggle
4. Will use create_file to restore original HTML content
</thinking>

I'll restore the original HTML file.

                <p>Designed and developed a medical injection prototype using Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) 3D printing technology. Carefully selected and implemented medical-grade materials to ensure biocompatibility and functionality:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Needle:</strong> Engineered using 316L Stainless Steel for its biocompatibility and corrosion resistance, with PEEK polymer alternative for 3D printing applications</li>
                    <li><strong>Syringe Barrel:</strong> Developed with transparent Polycarbonate (PC) and PETG materials for durability and sterilization compatibility</li>
                    <li><strong>Plunger System:</strong> Designed with medical-grade Polypropylene (PP) for chemical resistance and Medical Silicone for airtight sealing</li>
                    <li><strong>Seal Mechanism:</strong> Implemented Thermoplastic Elastomer (TPE) components for smooth operation and leak prevention</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Utilized Fusion 360 for material simulation and prototyping, ensuring compliance with medical device standards. Conducted rigorous testing to validate design functionality and material performance.</p>
